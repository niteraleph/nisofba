SYNTAX: nisofba [operation] [option] [option variable]...[source] [destination]
where, operation is the action taken by the user, source is the file/directory we want to use and destination is the file we want to set as backup destination

OPERATIONS:
set-default-destination [destination] --> sets the default destination

add [source] optional[--list=<listID>] optional[destination] --> adds the file/directory under source to the default backup list, unless list is specified. If destination is specified, the destination will change from the standard one and set for now on to this (currently no d option works)

backup optional[source] optional[--list=<listID>] optional[-r] --> backs up all files/directories in the default backup list, unless list is specified. "-r" option replaces the files, even if they have not been modified since last backup.

remove [source] optional[--list=<listID>] --> removes the source files/directories from the default backup list, or the specified list if given.
